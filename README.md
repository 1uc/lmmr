# LMMR
The package `lmmr` is a collection of Python code I'd like to reuse. Mostly it
consists of simplified interfaces to existing built-in libraries. As an
example, I just want to read and write files, the boiler-plate to open and
close the file can be hidden in my use-cases.

**Note:** Probably you don't want to use this package. It's open-source mostly
for the purpose of having easy access to it. Nevertheless, you're free to use
any of it in your own projects.
